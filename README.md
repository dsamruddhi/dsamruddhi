### Hi there! I'm Sammy.
I am currently an MPhil student at the <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/home">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>, supervised by <a href="https://eermurch.home.ece.ust.hk/">Prof. Ross Murch</a>. My focus is solving inverse problems using statistical and deep learning techniques. I am currently working on Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve Inverse Scattering problems.
